# Rotor Unbalance & ISO 1940 Balancing Calculator

## Overview
High-speed rotors experience massive centrifugal forces due to microscopic mass asymmetries ($F = m \cdot r \cdot \omega^2$). This tool calculates the radial forces generated by unbalance and determines the permissible residual unbalance based on ISO 1940-1 (e.g., G2.5, G6.3) for various rotor types.

## Features
1. **Centrifugal Force Calculator**: Input unbalance mass, radius, and RPM to get the resulting radial force.
2. **ISO 1940-1 Permissible Unbalance**: Select a balance quality grade and rotor mass to calculate the maximum permissible residual unbalance ($U_{per}$) in g·mm.
3. **Correction Mass Estimator**: Given a correction radius, determine the mass required to bring the rotor within the specified ISO grade.
4. **Visualizations**: 
   - A plot of Unbalance Force vs. RPM to show the quadratic relationship.
   - A gauge showing the current unbalance relative to the permissible limit.

## Implementation Details
- **Module**: `pycalcs/rotor_dynamics.py`
- **Functions**:
  - `calculate_unbalance_force(unbalance_g_mm, rpm)`
  - `get_iso_1940_perissible_unbalance(grade, rotor_mass_kg, max_rpm)`
- **UI**: Tabbed interface with inputs for operating conditions, rotor geometry, and ISO grading. Include a database of typical ISO grades for common machinery (e.g., electric motors, gas turbines, pump impellers).

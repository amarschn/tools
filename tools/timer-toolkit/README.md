# Timer Toolkit

A versatile, general-purpose timer application that fits within a larger library of web-based tools.

## Features

This tool provides three distinct timer modes in a clean, tabbed interface:

1.  **Stopwatch:**
    *   Standard count-up timer.
    *   Measures elapsed time with millisecond precision.
    *   Includes a **Lap** feature to record split times without stopping the timer.

2.  **Countdown:**
    *   Standard count-down timer.
    *   Set a duration in hours, minutes, and seconds.
    *   Provides a clear audio-visual alert when the time is up.

3.  **Interval Timer:**
    *   A configurable timer for cyclical activities like workouts or study sessions (e.g., Pomodoro).
    *   Set a "Work" period, a "Rest" period, and the number of rounds.
    *   The app will automatically cycle through the work and rest intervals, providing alerts at each transition.

## Design

The UI is designed to be extremely clean and minimalist, focusing on readability and ease of use. It features a responsive layout that works well on both desktop and mobile browsers.

# Example Tool - Settings Panel

## Purpose
Demonstrate a tool-level settings panel that controls auto-calculate, theme, density,
precision, and equation visibility while keeping the core calculation simple.

## Requirements
- Use the shared Pyodide loader and docstring-driven tooltips.
- Include a settings panel with the following preferences:
  - Auto-calculate toggle
  - Theme (light, dark, system)
  - Density (comfort, compact)
  - Precision (2, 3, 4 decimals)
  - Show equations by default
- Persist settings in local storage and apply them on load.
- Keep inputs organized with progressive disclosure (core vs advanced).

## Notes
This example is meant to be a staging ground for future tool settings patterns.

# Generic Tool Calculator

### Purpose of This Tool

This tool is designed to calculate **Result 1** and **Result 2** based on four user-provided parameters. It serves as a demonstration of the engineering tools platform and a template for future development.

Its primary educational goal is to show how parameters can be combined in different ways (e.g., multiplication and division) to produce different outputs.

### Requirements

#### Python Logic

The tool requires the following Python logic, which must be present in the core library (e.g., `/py/library.py`):

* A function `calculate_results(p1, p2, p3, p4)` that accepts the four parameters.
* The function must return a dictionary (or similar object) containing `result_1`, `result_2`, and any intermediate steps needed for the UI.

#### UI

* The UI must provide inputs for all four parameters.
* It must display both `result_1` and `result_2` clearly.
* It must use the inline "Show Equation" feature to display the exact formula and substituted values for each result.
* It must include a placeholder for a visualization plot.

# Stacked Example Template

This example restructures the base template into a single-column flow: inputs appear first, followed by detailed results. A sticky summary card pins the most important outputs to the bottom of the viewport so they remain visible while scrolling long forms.

Highlights:

- Ideal for calculators that have dozens of grouped parameters, where vertical scanning is easier than side-by-side panes.
- Results tabs remain available, but the quick summary updates in place to keep primary values front of mind.
- Shared Pyodide/docstring logic matches the standard template; only layout CSS and the summary helper are different.

Choose this template when the inputs dominate screen space or when you want users to progress from top to bottom like a workbook.***

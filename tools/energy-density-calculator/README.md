# Energy Density & Storage Calculator

## Purpose
This tool calculates the system-level mass and volume required to store energy for various types of vehicles across a range of energy media (batteries and fuels).

## Features
- Compares two energy storage options side-by-side.
- Accounts for conversion efficiency (ICE vs. Fuel Cell vs. Electric Motor).
- Accounts for structural/container overhead (battery pack packaging, high-pressure hydrogen tanks, fuel tanks).
- Visualizes results using Plotly charts.

## Usage
Select a vehicle type to populate a typical energy consumption rate (Wh/km) or choose "Custom" to enter your own. Enter the target range. Select two energy storage options to compare their mass and volume requirements.

## References
Values for energy density and system overhead are illustrative estimates based on typical industry metrics.

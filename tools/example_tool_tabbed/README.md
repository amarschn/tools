# Tabbed Example Template

This variant keeps the two-column layout but introduces internal tabs for the input pane. It demonstrates how to break large parameter sets into themed sections (e.g., Geometry, Material, Environment) without cluttering the screen.

Included features:

- Input tab buttons toggle between form sections with a small helper scriptâ€”no external dependencies required.
- Disabled placeholder fields show where additional groups can be inserted.
- Outputs and Pyodide integration behave exactly like the baseline template, ensuring compatibility.

Use this template when your calculator benefits from wizard-like organization or when inputs span distinct categories that users tackle sequentially.***

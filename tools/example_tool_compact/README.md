# Compact Example Template

This variant of the base example template demonstrates a two-column layout with condensed spacing. Inputs are arranged in a responsive grid so tools with many fields keep most parameters visible without scrolling.

Key differences from the standard template:

- Reduced card padding and typography for denser forms.
- Input controls flow in a multi-column grid on wider screens, automatically stacking on mobile.
- Buttons and tab headers use tighter spacing to maximize vertical real estate.
- Includes a disabled placeholder field to show where additional inputs can be added without stretching the layout.

Use this template when creating calculators that have a large number of simple inputs and still benefit from side-by-side results.***

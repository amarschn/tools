# Weighted Decision Matrix

A tool for making rational, quantifiable decisions when comparing multiple options against a set of weighted criteria.

## What is a Weighted Decision Matrix?

A weighted decision matrix (also known as a Pugh matrix or decision grid) is a simple but powerful tool for decision-making. It helps you compare different options by scoring them against a list of criteria that you define and weight according to their importance.

This method moves beyond simple pro/con lists by forcing you to consider *how much* each criterion matters, providing a more rational and less emotional basis for your choice.

## How to Use the Tool

1.  **Define Your Criteria:**
    *   In the "Criteria" input section, list all the factors that are important for your decision (e.g., Cost, Features, Ease of Use).
    *   Assign a **weight** to each criterion. The weights represent the relative importance of each factor. They are automatically normalized to sum to 100%.

2.  **List Your Options:**
    *   In the "Options" section, list the different choices you are evaluating (e.g., Product A, Product B, Option 1).

3.  **Score Your Options:**
    *   A matrix will be generated in the right-hand panel.
    *   For each option, score it against each criterion. A common scale is 0 to 10, where 0 is very poor and 10 is excellent.

4.  **Review the Results:**
    *   As you fill in the scores, the **Total Score** for each option is calculated automatically.
    *   The "Ranked Results" section shows you which option has the highest weighted score, providing a clear, data-driven recommendation.

## Example

Imagine choosing a new car. Your criteria might be:
*   `Price` (Weight: 40)
*   `Fuel Economy` (Weight: 30)
*   `Safety Rating` (Weight: 20)
*   `Style` (Weight: 10)

You would then score each car model against those criteria to see which one best meets your weighted needs.

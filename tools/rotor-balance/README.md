# Rotor Balancing & ISO 1940 Calculator

## Purpose
This tool calculates the maximum permissible residual unbalance of a rigid rotor according to ISO 1940-1 balancing quality grades. It also calculates the resulting centrifugal forces and required correction masses when given an actual measured unbalance.

## Features
- Calculates ISO 1940-1 permissible unbalance ($U_{per}$) for grades G0.4 to G40.
- Estimates the specific unbalance or permissible eccentricity ($e_{per}$).
- Calculates the true radial centrifugal force caused by a given mass unbalance at the operating speed.
- Determines the required correction mass at a specified radius.
- Plots the quadratic relationship between centrifugal force and rotor speed.

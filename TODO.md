# Engineering Tools Backlog

This backlog consolidates platform work, template upgrades, and future tool ideas that span from lightweight utilities to large, multi-module experiences.

## Platform Improvements

- [ ] Implement a reusable SI/Imperial unit toggle in the shared template and apply it across tools.
- [ ] Design a schema-driven input renderer for tools with large parameter counts (auto-tooltips, validation, tabs).
- [ ] Convert legacy tools to the standard template (`beam-bending`, `simple_thermal`, `door-spring-app`, `fits`, `mtbf`, `trajectory`, `wire-sizing`).
- [ ] Establish automated docstring validation to enforce `---Parameters---` / `---Returns---` / `---LaTeX---` sections.
- [ ] Build a shared visualization helper (Plotly/Chart.js adapters) to reduce duplicated plotting code.
- [ ] Create integration tests that load each tool in Pyodide and exercise nominal + error paths.
- [x] Deploy Reynolds Number Explorer (fluid mechanics sanity-check tool).
- [x] Add Composite Wall Heat Loss calculator with interface temperature visualization.

## Aerospace Engineering Tools

- [ ] Airfoil lift and drag estimator with NACA parser and Cp plots.
- [ ] Tsiolkovsky rocket equation planner (staging, propellant tables, delta-v budget).
- [ ] Orbital mechanics sandbox (two-body propagator, transfer maneuvers, 3D visualization).
- [ ] Hypersonic stagnation heating calculator for blunt bodies (complex).

## Civil & Mechanical Engineering Tools

- [ ] Beam deflection and combined stress calculator with superposition library.
- [ ] Mohr's circle visualization with failure envelopes.
- [ ] Truss analysis tool using method of joints + determinacy checker.
- [ ] Shaft analysis module (critical speed, torsional stress, bearing loads).

- [ ] Fastener torque and preload calculator with tightening strategies.
- [ ] Interference-fit predictor including thermal assembly planning.
- [ ] Vibration isolation selector (spring-damper tuning, transmissibility plots).
- [ ] Structural bolted joint fatigue life estimator (complex).

## Thermal & Fluid Sciences Tools

- [ ] Heat exchanger sizing and rating assistant (LMTD, effectiveness-NTU).
- [ ] Pump/fan selection tool that intersects system and pump curves.
- [ ] Refrigeration cycle analyzer with property tables and COP visualization.

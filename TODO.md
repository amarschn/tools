## Implementation Suggestions

### For New Tools

- **Start simple, add complexity later**
  - Begin with core calculations and a minimal user interface.
  - Incrementally add visualizations and advanced features.
  
- **Leverage shared libraries**
  - Use common JavaScript libraries across tools (e.g., Chart.js, MathJax).
  - Create a shared styling framework for a consistent look and feel.
  
- **Progressive enhancement**
  - Ensure tools work at a basic level even without JavaScript.
  - Add interactive features that enhance the experience but arenâ€™t required.
  
- **Mobile-first approach**
  - Design for small screens first.
  - Expand the layout for larger screens with responsive design.

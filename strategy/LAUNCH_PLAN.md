# Launch Plan

## Current Reality

- **Traffic:** Zero (site exists but not discoverable)
- **Domain:** GitHub Pages subdomain (amarschn.github.io/tools)
- **Tools:** 39 total, 0 formally verified
- **Discoverability:** None (no SEO, no marketing, no domain authority)

This plan addresses what needs to happen before any monetization makes sense.

---

## Phase 0: Pre-Launch Requirements

### 0.1 Establish Core Verified Tools (5 minimum)

Before launch, need 5 tools that are:
- Fully tested against known solutions
- Equations verified against standards/textbooks
- Edge cases handled gracefully
- Mobile-responsive
- Clear "Verified" badge displayed

**Candidate tools for verification (based on current state):**

| Tool | Category | Verification Effort | Notes |
|------|----------|--------------------| ------|
| Bolt Torque Calculator | Mechanical | Medium | VDI 2230, well-documented |
| Beam Bending Calculator | Mechanical | Medium | Standard formulas |
| Unit Converter | Reference | Low | Straightforward validation |
| Battery Runtime Estimator | Electrical | Low | Simple math |
| Wire Sizing Calculator | Electrical | Low | NEC tables exist |
| Heat Transfer Calculator | Thermal | Medium | Standard correlations |
| Reynolds Number Explorer | Fluids | Low | Simple formula |

**Verification process for each tool:**
- [ ] Document expected outputs for 5+ test cases
- [ ] Compare against hand calculations or known software
- [ ] Test edge cases (zero, negative, extreme values)
- [ ] Peer review if possible
- [ ] Add "Verified" badge with verification date

### 0.2 Experimental Badge System

All non-verified tools need clear "Experimental" status:
- Visual badge on tool page
- Disclaimer in results
- Listed separately in catalog or filtered by default

**UI treatment options:**
1. Yellow/orange "Experimental" badge
2. Separate "Experimental" section in catalog
3. Toggle to show/hide experimental tools
4. Warning banner on experimental tool pages

### 0.3 Domain & Basic Infrastructure

| Task | Priority | Cost |
|------|----------|------|
| Register domain (e.g., engcalcs.com, calcs.engineer) | High | $10-50/year |
| Set up Netlify hosting | High | Free |
| Configure custom domain | High | Free |
| Set up basic analytics | Medium | Free |
| Create robots.txt and sitemap | Medium | Free |

**Domain name options to check:**
- engcalcs.com
- engineeringcalcs.com
- calcs.engineer
- calctools.io
- opensourcecalcs.com
- Something memorable and short

---

## Phase 1: Soft Launch

### 1.1 Minimum Viable Launch Checklist

- [ ] 5 verified tools with badges
- [ ] All other tools marked "Experimental"
- [ ] Custom domain configured
- [ ] Analytics installed
- [ ] Terms of Service page
- [ ] Privacy Policy page
- [ ] About page (who made this, why, transparency about AI)
- [ ] Contact method (email or GitHub issues)
- [ ] Mobile responsive confirmed
- [ ] Basic SEO (titles, descriptions, sitemap)

### 1.2 Initial Traffic Sources (Free)

| Source | Effort | Expected Impact |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Reddit (r/engineering, r/mechanicalengineering, r/AskEngineers) | Low | Medium - if genuinely useful, not spammy |
| Hacker News | Low | High if it catches on, unpredictable |
| LinkedIn personal network | Low | Low-Medium |
| GitHub trending | Low | Low |
| Engineering Discord servers | Low | Low-Medium |
| University subreddits | Low | Low |

**Key principle:** Don't spam. Share when genuinely relevant to discussions. "I made this" posts work once.

### 1.3 Content Marketing (Slow but Sustainable)

| Content Type | SEO Value | Effort |
|--------------|-----------|--------|
| Blog posts explaining calculations | High | Medium |
| Tutorial videos (YouTube) | Medium | High |
| Worked examples in tool pages | High | Low |
| Comparison articles (vs. competitors) | Medium | Medium |

---

## Phase 2: Growth

### 2.1 SEO Strategy

**Target keywords (long-tail first):**
- "bolt torque calculator vdi 2230"
- "beam bending calculator with diagram"
- "battery runtime calculator mah"
- "free engineering calculator online"
- Specific standards: "ISO 898-1 bolt calculator"

**Content approach:**
- Each tool page is a landing page
- Background/theory section helps SEO
- Worked examples target specific searches
- Blog posts for broader topics

### 2.2 Backlink Opportunities

| Source | How |
|--------|-----|
| Engineering blogs | Guest posts, mentions |
| University course pages | Reach out to professors |
| GitHub awesome-lists | Submit to relevant lists |
| Stack Exchange | Answer questions, link when relevant |
| Wikipedia (careful) | Add as external reference if appropriate |

### 2.3 Community Building

- GitHub Discussions for feature requests
- Discord server (optional, high maintenance)
- Email newsletter (low effort, high value)
- Twitter/X for updates

## Success Metrics by Phase

### Pre-Launch (Phase 0)
- [ ] 5 tools verified
- [ ] Experimental badges on all others
- [ ] Domain registered and configured

### Soft Launch (Phase 1)
- [ ] 100 unique visitors in first month
- [ ] At least 1 external mention/link
- [ ] No critical bugs reported

### Growth (Phase 2)
- [ ] 1,000 monthly visitors
- [ ] Appearing in search results for target keywords
- [ ] 10+ GitHub stars
- [ ] First donation or sign of monetization viability

## Timeline (Realistic)

| Milestone | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| 5 verified tools complete | Week 2-3 |
| Domain + Netlify configured | Week 1 |
| Soft launch (share on Reddit/HN) | Week 3-4 |
| First 100 visitors | Week 4-6 |
| First 1,000 visitors | Month 2-3 |
| Monetization experiments | Month 3+ (only if traffic exists) |

---

## Anti-Goals

Things we're NOT doing yet:
- Paid advertising (no point without proven product-market fit)
- Complex monetization (ads, subscriptions)
- Building features no one asked for
- Scaling before validating

---

## Open Questions

1. What domain name?
2. Which 5 tools to verify first?
3. How to display experimental vs. verified in the UI?
4. Who can help verify tools? (peer review)
5. What's the "about" story? (transparency about AI, personal project, etc.)
